title: About

I'm a Strategy & Business Operations Analyst at [Trulia](http://www.trulia.com), where I support our advertising business through data analysis. I plan to  use this blog mainly as a forum to write about data, programming, and statistics.

My other interests are rock climbing, cycling, reading, and exploring Northern California.
