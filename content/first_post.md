A few excellent libraries/services are powering this blog:

* [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a static site generator written in Python

* [Github pages](http://pages.github.com) for hosting

* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdow/) for writing posts

In the past, I've run blogs off of Wordpress, but I prefer this setup. For one, both the blog itself (posts, CSS) and the code powering it (Python) is up on Github, and so version controled and in the same place I put code, my resume, notes, etc. Secondly, writing in markdown is much more pleasant than using any of the WYSIWYG editors on the big blogging platforms.

There are a number of tutorials online for setting up a blog this way. I found [this](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html) very helpful and recommend it to anyone looking to set up a blog using Pelican. Knowledge of Python isn't necessary, only a bit of command-line knowledge (`cd`-ing around, making directories with `mkdir`), and git knowledge if you want to host through Github.
